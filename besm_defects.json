COMBAT VALUECOMBAT VALUE Combat Value governs all facets of physical conflict, including your character\u2019s abilities in attacking, defending, and delivering damage. A higher Combat Value reflects fighting spirit and an increased knowledge of all physical combat forms: armed, unarmed, martial arts, and ranged weapons. There are two separate components of the Combat Value \u2013 Attack Combat Value (ACV) and Defence Combat Value (DCV). Attributes and Defects may modify either component separately. Prowess in combat can only be achieved through harmony of the Complete Self. Lack of self-unity through weakness of any facet of the character will restrict their ability in combat. Consequently, the Body, Mind, and Soul Stats are all of equal importance to the combat master: Body Stat for a forceful attack and defence; Mind Stat for quick wit, knowledge of combat techniques and anticipation of an opponent\u2019s actions; and Soul Stat for the winning spirit and good fortune. For example, a petite character with martial arts training can take down an opponent nearly twice their size since knowledge and determination is just as important as brute force. Your character\u2019s base Combat Value is calculated by adding together all the Stat Values and dividing by three, rounding down. The Attack Combat Value is equal to the base Combat Value, +1 per Level of the character\u2019s Attack Mastery Attribute (page 80). ACV may be increased in specific circumstances as determined by the Enemy Attack (page 90), Melee Attack (page 102), and Ranged Attack (page 116) Attributes. The Defence Combat Value is equal to the base Combat Value, +1 per Level of the character\u2019s Defence Mastery Attribute (page 88). DCV may be increased in specific circumstances as determined by the Enemy Defence (page 90), Melee Defence (page 103), and Ranged Defence (page 116) Attributes. 08: DERIVED VALUES PAGEPAGE 169169 COMBAT      BODY    MIND    SOULCOMBAT      BODY    MIND    SOUL VALUE          STATVALUE          STAT STAT   STAT  STAT   STAT           = = ((      +    ++    +      ))\u00f7\u00f733Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 171--- DERIVED VALUES DERIVED VALUES HEALTH POINTSHEALTH POINTS Health Points measure the amount of physical damage your character\u2019s body can sustain before it ceases to function (i.e. your character is knocked unconscious or even dies). Damage delivered in combat is subtracted from your character\u2019s current Health Point total. If the total ever falls below zero, the character is rendered unconscious and may die if they do not receive medical attention. Your character\u2019s base number of Health Points is equal to the sum of the Body Stat and Soul Stat multiplied by 5 ([Body + Soul) x 5]). Increase Health Points by +10 for every Level of the character\u2019s Tough Attribute (page 128). Reduce Health Points by -10 for every -1 Rank of the Fragile Defect (page 158).ENERGY POINTSENERGY POINTS Characters possess a personal reserve of energy that may be burned when carrying out difficult tasks. Energy Points are needed to fuel Attributes that are associated with the Deplete Limiter (page 149). If your character\u2019s Energy Point total is ever reduced to 0, they will fall unconscious from exhaustion. Energy Points are also used to represent deprivation such as hunger, thirst, fatigue, lack of sleep, and even intense emotion such as crippling fear or stress. In some instances (such as hunger and thirst), if a character\u2019s Energy Points are at 0 and continue to decline, they will begin to lose Health Points instead. In extreme moments, player characters can use Energy Points to temporarily provide a bonus to a dice roll. The character may spend these Points after rolling the dice, applying a +1 dice roll bonus for every 10 Energy Points the character burns. A character may add a maximum bonus to a single roll equal to their Soul Stat. See Dramatic Feats (page 195) for more information on modifying dice rolls with Energy Points. 08: DERIVED VALUES PAGEPAGE 170170 HEALTH         BODY   SOUL HEALTH         BODY   SOUL POINTS         STAT     STATPOINTS         STAT     STAT          = = (    +     )(    +     ) X5X5Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 172--- DERIVED VALUES DERIVED VALUES Players and the GM are cautioned that the over-use of Energy Points can slow the pace of a game and greatly increase the amount of bookkeeping. Additionally, your character may tire quickly if you assign the Deplete Limiter to several Attributes, which prevents your character from using them over sustained periods. Whether this is appropriate for your character or not depends on how you envision your hero. Your character\u2019s base number of Energy Point is equal to the sum of the Mind Stat and Soul Stat multiplied by 5 ([Mind + Soul] x 5).

A player simply In a role-playing game like BESM, most character or NPC actions do not require any particular rules. A player simply states that their character walks across a room, picks up an object, drives a vehicle, talks to someone, etc., and if the GM states that their character walks across a room, picks up an object, drives a vehicle, talks to someone, etc., and if the GM agrees that the action is possible and can be performed without much difficulty, this simply happens. Personal interaction agrees that the action is possible and can be performed without much difficulty, this simply happens. Personal interaction between characters or NPCs is at the heart of role-playing games and this is what sets them apart from other tabletop between characters or NPCs is at the heart of role-playing games and this is what sets them apart from other tabletop games such as board, miniature, and party games. The players and GM will spend most of their role-playing time talking games such as board, miniature, and party games.

Throughout the course of a game, circumstances may arise where specific rules can help determine what happens. This is usually the case when the outcome of an action or event is uncertain and the result is important to the story. If a character needs to fix a broken reactor pump to prevent a nuclear meltdown, can they do it in time? If a character\u2019s car drives off a cliff, can they jump clear in time, and if not, how badly will the crash injure the character? If two people fight, who wins? A character\u2019s Stats, Attributes, Skill Groups, and Derived Values help resolve these dramatic questions. In many cases, dice rolls can add additional hazard and drama to the action. The dice rolls represent elements beyond the direct control of the character or the uncertainty that results when opposing characters interact. In some situations, the GM may elect to determine the results without rolling dice (see Should You Roll The Dice?, page 180). The GM may do so if they think a particular outcome is certain (whether a success or a failure) or a particular outcome is dramatically necessary to the game. One situation the rules cover in greater detail is combat. The game mechanics for physical conflict are explicit to give players greater control over their characters\u2019 actions when engaged in a mortal struggle. If they lose, they will know the GM has not arbitrarily injured or killed their characters. The GM can also follow a similar procedure with any other actions that affect a character\u2019s fate: treat routine activities in passing and delve into more detail whenever an action impacts the characters physically or emotionally. DESCRIBING ACTIONSDESCRIBING ACTIONS Characters can perform or attempt a nearly endless list of actions. These can be mundane activities (talking, breathing, thinking, etc.), skilled activities (building a suit of power armour, hacking into a computer, moving silently, climbing the side of a building, etc.), or combat activities (fighting, dodging, shooting, etc.).Every GM has a preferred method for having players describe their characters\u2019 actions. Usually this involves the GM moving from player to player and asking, \u201cWhat is your character doing?\u201d Experienced GMs try to give each person equal role-playing time so that everyone is an important facet of the story (switching between characters as necessary). Players are responsible for relating their characters\u2019 intended actions to the GM, who describes the results of those actions or requests a Stat or Skill roll to determine the outcome. Consider the three action descriptions below: \u00bb\u201cMy character, Akira, is going to search for the missing sword.\u201d \u00bb\u201cMy character, Akira, is going to search for the missing sword in the basement of the building.\u201d \u00bb\u201cMy character, Akira, is going to quickly search for the missing sword in the basement of the building. He will knock down doors if necessary in order to find it as quickly as possible.\u201d All three accounts involve Akira looking for a lost sword but the level of detail is quite different. You should not be overly concerned with detail if it is irrelevant to your character\u2019s actions (such as exactly how Akira is forcing open the doors in the final description), but sometimes a little detail can greatly alter the GM\u2019s interpretation of the event. There is an expansion book in our anime and manga RPG adventure line called BESM Extras that is dedicated to rules variations, extended game system mechanics, expanded optional notes and guidelines, and plenty of ready-to- use examples.

In some situations, such as a conversation between two characters, the flow of game time normally matches real world time. More often, the amount of time that passes depends on the characters\u2019 activities as set by the players\u2019 actions \u2013 things happen as soon as dramatically appropriate. Climbing a high mountain may just takes a few short minutes of description, or a few die rolls, to resolve. It does not take the many hours that climbing a mountain would really take. The GM should telescope time until something interesting happens: \u201cT wo weeks pass while you investigate the crime. Then the terrorist broadcasts a message, announcing their plans to destroy Tokyo Tower if their demands are not met.\u201d GMs may go back in time as well to employ flashback scenes, which are useful tools to establish the background for a story without simply recounting the information in dry fashion. Finally, in very dramatic situations such as combat, the GM may keep very precise track of time by using individual \u201ccombat rounds\u201d (see Combat, page 183). SCENE, ROUND, AND SCENE, ROUND, AND INITIATIVEINITIATIVE T wo common measures of game time are a dramatic scene and a round. A dramatic scene is any situation where the events remain linked, moment-to-moment. Think of it in movie terms \u2013 a scene lasts until the camera cuts to an entirely new setting, potentially with new characters. If, for example, a player-character is speaking with an informant in a diner, the entire conversation constitutes a scene. Once the GM switches scenes to the character entering a back alley, following up on the informant\u2019s lead, the diner scene ends and a new scene begins in the back alley. If the conversation was interrupted instead by a villain attacking the informant, intent on shutting them up before he could reveal any important information, the scene would not yet end when the character chased the villain down a back alleyway. Since the events are still linked moment- to-moment, it is still a part of a singular dramatic scene even if the setting has changed. A round is a measure of time of approximately 3-4 seconds in length, while an Initiative is one specific moment in time. A round is primarily used for combat situations and is the amount of time in which an average person can react to a situation, make a decision, and perform a significant action during a battle or other stressful situation.When combat occurs, characters roll Initiative (page 182) and each character is allowed to act in order of their Initiative (with those characters with higher Initiative numbers acting earlier in the round than those with lower Initiative numbers). DICE ROLLSDICE ROLLS BESM uses standard six-sided dice (also known affectionately as 2d6) during game play. When a random number needs to be generated, two dice are usually rolled (see Edges and Obstacles, page 182, for exceptions to this). By adding the two numbers shown on each die, values between 2 and 12 are generated. The range of dice rolls produces a triangular distribution (a cousin to the bell curve), with the middle value of 7 generated most frequently (one-sixth of all rolls). Rolls are made during a BESM game to determine the success or failure of important actions performed by the player characters or by NPCs interacting with them. Rolls are only needed for actions where the character\u2019s success is uncertain. The GM can decide that an action succeeds or fails without a roll, and many routine or minor actions should be resolved this way. See Should You Roll The Dice? (page 180) If the GM decides a dice roll is required, the player rolls two dice and adds the relevant Stat, Combat Value, or Attribute Level modifier to the number rolled. The resulting sum is called the \u201ctotal roll.\u201d The higher the total roll, the better the character\u2019s attempt. The total roll is compared to either a Target Number (page 177) or opposed roll (page 178) to determine if the task was successful. WHO ROLLS THE DICE? In most cases, a player rolls dice to determine the success of an action their character performs, while the GM rolls the dice to determine the results of NPC actions when they impact the characters. In situations where NPCs are only involved with other NPCs, the GM should simply decide what happens rather than rolling dice. In some circumstances, the GM may roll the dice to determine the results of a character\u2019s action instead of having a player roll to keep the actual dice roll \u2013 and the reason for rolling \u2013 secret. This is normally done if having the player roll would give away an event that should remain unknown to the character. For example, if there is something hidden that the character may or may not notice, the GM can secretly roll dice to see if the character spots it. If the GM allowed the player to roll the dice, the player would know that a clue existed even if the character did not succeed in noticing it. 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 176176Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 178--- ACTION ACTION TARGET NUMBERSTARGET NUMBERS The success of most non-combat rolls is determined by comparing them to a Target Number or TN (see the table above). The GM assigns the task under consideration a Target Number before the roll is made. If the total roll is equal or higher than the Target Number, the task succeeds. If it was lower, it fails. GMs should assign Target Numbers based on how easy or difficult the task is to perform. When in doubt, assign an average difficult Target Number of 12. For example, driving a car along a busy highway would not normally require any dice rolls for most people in a modern setting, since driving is routine. Driving on the highway at high speeds during inclement weather might require a dice roll, though ... probably a Simple task (TN 6) or an Easy task (TN 9). Racing along in a complex construction zone in ideal weather conditions is perhaps an Average task (TN 12) or perhaps a Difficult task (TN 15) in inclement weather. If the car\u2019s brakes no longer work, racing along the highway may become a Challenging task (TN 18) or Unlikely task (TN 21) instead. Attempting to do so while blindfolded \u2013 and merely using the sound of the traffic to guide the wheel \u2013 is an Improbable task (TN 24). The GM usually tells the player the task\u2019s Target Number before the player rolls. In some instances, though, the GM can keep the Target Number a secret to create dramatic tension and only reveal it after the character\u2019s total roll resulted in success or failure. TARGET\tNUMBERS DifficultyTarget NumberInterpretation Simple 6Almost everyone will succeed Easy 9Characters will very rarely fail Average 12 Success often requires some talent or training Difficult 15Success often requires above-average ability Challenging 18Success often requires significant ability Unlikely 21Success requires exceptional ability Improbable 24 Success requires unparalleled ability16 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 177177 Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 179--- ACTION ACTION OPPOSED ROLLSOPPOSED ROLLS Instead of setting a specific Target Number, the GM may decide that a task requires an opposed roll. This is appropriate for any situation that involves a direct competition between opponents, such as arm wrestling, a game of chess, an interrogation, or combat. In an opposed roll situation, the two (or more) characters involved each roll their own dice. The character with the higher total roll (for example, a dice roll + Stat + Skill Group) succeeds. If the result is a tie, the active character (such as the attacker in combat or the challenger in a game of chess) wins over the reacting character. If both characters can reasonably be considered active and a tied result is reasonable \u2013 such as in a running or car race \u2013 the contest is a draw; otherwise, re-roll to break the tie. So how does the GM set the Target Number for a given task? You can better understand what the reasonable values should be used if you grasp the probabilities of success or failure. Consider a person with values of 4 in each Stat (human average) and slightly skilled in an area (Skill Group at Level 1). Since a value of 7 is rolled a little more than 50% of the time on two dice, this average person will succeed a little more than 50% of the time when performing Average tasks (Stat 4 + Skill 1 + Roll 7 = 12 ... equalling the average Target Number of 12). All Target Numbers were set with these parameters in mind. For your convenience, the probabilities for rolling specific values or higher are listed below: Dice\tValueChance of Rolling This Value\tor\tHigher 2 100% 3 97% 4 92% 5 83% 6 72% 7 58% 8 42% 9 28% 10 17% 11 8% 12 3% When setting a Target Number for the task, remember that a 7 or higher will be rolled about half the time. If you subtract 7 from the Target Number, the remaining number is the minimum Stat + Skill Group total the character must have to succeed, on average, half the time. For example, if you look at a Challenging task (TN 18), and subtract 7 from that target value, the remaining result is 11. Consequently, to have a roughly average chance of succeeding, the character\u2019s Stat + Skill Group must equal 11 \u2013 clearly not common in a low-powered game! While it is possible for a slightly above-average character with a Stat of 5 and Skill Group of 1 to succeed while performing a Challenging task (only if they roll a 12), it is extremely unlikely \u2013 only a 3% chance! That\u2019s why it\u2019s called Challenging. Setting Target Numbers is not difficult, provided you understand what your goal is regarding the chance for character success and failure.UNDERSTANDING TARGET\tNUMBERS 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 178178 Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 180--- ACTION ACTION ROLL TYPESROLL TYPES There are five types of dice rolls used during game play: a Stat roll, a Skill roll, an Initiative roll, an attack roll, and a defence roll. Each of these rolls test a particular facet of a character\u2019s abilities. When a player announces the intended actions of their character, the GM must decide if a dice roll is necessary. Should a roll be required, the GM chooses which type of roll is most appropriate, based on these guidelines. Attack and defence rolls are described in additional detail in the combat sectionlater in this chapter (page 183). The other three types of rolls are explored below. SSTAT ROLLSTAT ROLLS A Stat roll is used when the GM believes that innate ability is more important than any learned expertise or combat capability in resolving the success of a particular action. An example of a Stat roll would be a Body Stat roll to force open a locked door using brute strength. Another important use for Stat rolls is to see if a character can resist the effects of something bad, such as mind control, poison, or shock. The GM decides which Stat (Body, Mind, or Soul) is being tested by the action or situation. See the Stat descriptions in Chapter 4 (page 70) for a list of activities that are associated with particular Stats. For Stat rolls that relate to an Attribute, the relevant Stat is often suggested in the Attribute description. If the GM feels two or three Stats are closely related to the action, an average Stat Value can be calculated instead, rounding up to the closest whole number. The success of a Stat roll is determined by rolling two dice and adding the relevant Stat and any situational modifiers. The result is the total roll. This is compared to either the Target Number (page 177) or to an opposed roll (page 178) to determine if the task was successful. The GM must decide whether a Stat roll is made against a Target Number or is an opposed roll. If it is an opposed roll, the GM must decide what type of roll opposes it. This may be the same type of roll \u2013 for example, Body Stat versus Body Stat in a wrestling contest. Or it could be a different Stat, such as opposing Body versus Soul when seducing an innocent. In some situations, the GM may also decide that a Stat roll is opposed by another type of roll, such as a Skill roll. A character\u2019s Attributes or Defects can sometimes modify certain Stat rolls. For example, the Mind Shield Attribute (page 109) adds a +2 bonus per Level to any Mind Stat rolls when resisting psychic intrusion. Conversely, the Shortcoming Defect (page 164) penalises Stat rolls related to the specific deficient Stat aspect.  UUSING ATTRIBUTESSING ATTRIBUTES If an Attribute does not specifically require a Stat roll, GMs can assume they function automatically in most situations. Of course, the Game Master may decide that a roll is necessary in unusual circumstances. For example, a character with the Features (Appearance) Attribute always looks good, but the GM might require a Soul Stat roll if they are attempting to attract someone\u2019s attention. Certain Attributes occasionally require Stat rolls (or sometimes Attack, Defence, or Skill rolls) to properly use the Attribute, while other Attributes and Defects provide modifiers to existing rolls, as noted in their descriptions in Chapters 5-7. SSKILL ROLLSKILL ROLLS A Skill roll is similar to a Stat roll, except it is used when the task is one that the GM decides would be governed by both a Stat and a particular Skill Group Attribute (page 120). If a task requires general intellectual ability (such as remembering the name of a person the character had met), the character normally makes a simple Mind Stat roll. Deciphering a scroll written in a rare alien language would also require a Mind Stat roll, but this task falls under the umbrella of the Academic Skill Group. In game terminology, this task would require a \u201cMind- Based Academic Skill Group roll\u201d \u2013 shortened to an \u201cAcademic Skill Roll\u201d. For such Skill rolls, add both the appropriate Stat and the Skill Group Level to the dice roll to determine the total roll. The GM is responsible for deciding which Stat and Skill Group are relevant to a particular task. Of course, the GM should listen to the player\u2019s reasoning why a particular Skill Group would apply to their roll, but the final decision belongs to the GM. The GM should select the Target Number before the player rolls, or decide if the roll is opposed. In opposed rolls, the GM also decides whether the roll is opposed by a Stat roll or Skill roll (or other type of roll) and what Stats or Skill Groups are involved. This may depend on a character\u2019s actions. Sometimes the opposing roll will involve the same Skill Group, but often a different Skill or a Stat roll is more appropriate. For example, during a tense interrogation scene, a Mind-based Street Skill roll could be opposed by: a Soul Stat roll (if someone tries to resist by sheer will power); a Mind Stat roll (if the character tries to trick the interrogator); a Body Stat roll (to tough out any physical abuse); a Business Skill roll (if the character tries to make a deal to stop the interrogation); an Adventuring Skill roll (if the character pretends to pass out during the interrogation); 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 179179Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 181--- ACTION ACTION etc. The GM decides which Stats or Skill Groups are valid, and there is plenty of opportunity for creativity when role-playing. SKILL\tSYNERGY It is possible for a character to have two or more Skill Groups that work well together during a specific task, such as the Technical and Scientific Skill Groups when trying to bypass a complex biomechanical lock. If the GM allows multiple Skill Groups to assist in the task, the character makes a Skill roll using the Skill Group ranked at the highest Level, gaining a minor edge (page 182) on the roll for one synergistic Skill Group or a major edge for two or more synergistic Skill Groups. COMBINING \tSKILL\tROLLS When more than one character applies the same Skill Group at the same time towards the same goal, their efforts may overlap \u2013 they can work together and help each other out. In this case, one character is considered the leader of the effort and the other characters are helpers. The leader receives a minor edge (page 182) if one or two other skilled characters are helping or a major edge if there are more than two helpers. The GM may limit co-operation in any situation where it would be inappropriate. UUNSKILLED ATTEMPTSNSKILLED ATTEMPTS Often, a character will attempt an action for which they do not possess the relative Skill Group. The approach in these situations is dependent on the nature of the action. FAMILIAR \tACTION If the character is undertaking a familiar action, yet lacks a relevant Skill Group, make a Stat roll instead of a Skill roll. The familiarity should have been established previously, such as in the character\u2019s background story, or should be consistent with the character\u2019s role within the setting. The player should explain to the GM why their character is familiar with the current task, with the GM having final say whether the character is sufficiently familiar with the task to avoid an unfamiliar action penalty (see below). For example, a student who attends university to study astronomy undoubtedly has at least a cursory familiarity with many academic fields. Similarly, almost all characters living in a big city may be familiar with the process of driving a car, even if they do not possess a relevant Skill Group. A hermit living in the depths of the Amazon, however, is likely not familiar with motor vehicles and therefore driving would be an unfamiliar action for that character. Not all actions require a dice roll. Obviously many mundane character activities, such as hammering a nail, riding a horse down a road, or eating lunch, should never need dice rolls unless there are exceptional circumstances surrounding the character\u2019s actions. In other situations, the necessity to roll dice is less obvious. If a character is virtually guaranteed to succeed at a task, then the GM should consider whether the roll is necessary. While it is true that the character might fail, having the player roll the dice will slow the game down. Consequently, GMs should recognise when a character is almost certainly going to succeed at an unopposed task and not request a dice roll. Game play can then continue uninterrupted. The following is a list of suggestions when the dice should and should not be rolled. If a roll is unnecessary, the character should gain an automatic success for the action. ROLL\tDICE\tWHEN... \u00bbthe unpredictability of dice adds to the excitement of the game \u00bbthe action is foreign to the character \u00bbthe action has been a weakness for the character in the past \u00bbthe character is somewhat distracted or cannot concentrate on their task \u00bbanother character or NPC is working directly against the character \u00bbthe action is not of trivial difficulty \u00bboutside forces influence the actions \u00bbthe player wants to roll the dice DO\tNOT\tROLL\tDICE\tWHEN... \u00bbrolling dice would reduce the enjoyment of the game \u00bbthe action is routine for the character \u00bbthe action requires a trivial amount of talent compared to the character\u2019s Skill Group Level \u00bbthe character is hedging on a roll (page 182) \u00bbstory flow is more important than the rollSHOULD YOU ROLL THE DICE? 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 180180Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 182--- Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 183--- ACTION ACTION UNFAMILIAR \tACTION If the character is undertaking an action with which they are unfamiliar, the task should be treated as a normal Stat roll but with a minor or major obstacle (page 182) applied to the roll \u2013 depending on how much the GM feels training is required and how background aspects of the character could affect the attempt. For example, keeping a plane in the air after the cabin crew suddenly falls unconscious is a daunting task for anyone who is not trained as a pilot. An average character might therefore receive a major obstacle to their Mind Stat roll. A character who is an aficionado of combat jets and aircraft documentaries might only receive a minor obstacle on the roll ... even if they have never actually piloted a plane before. REQUIRED SKILL The GM may decide certain tasks automatically fail when performed by characters lacking the required Skill. Examples of required Skill activities include: performing brain surgery, deciphering ancient hieroglyphics, concocting an antidote for a poison, estimating the value of a rare piece of art, etc. IINITIATIVE ROLLSNITIATIVE ROLLS Initiative rolls are a special type of roll made by participants at the start of a combat scene to determine the order in which they will act. Each participant in the battle makes an Initiative roll using the sum of two dice plus their Attack Combat Value (after modification by specific Attributes and Defects). In addition, the Lightning Reflexes Combat Technique (page 83) gives the character a minor or major edge on their roll. Initiative rolls determine the Initiative order, from the highest to the lowest total roll. See Initiative, page 188. BEYOND TWO DICEBEYOND TWO DICE Although most dice rolls involve simply rolling two six-sided dice as described earlier, situations may arise that result in the player rolling additional dice or no dice. EEDGES AND OBSTACLESDGES AND OBSTACLES Sometimes an Attribute, Enhancement, Limiter, or Defect provides distinct changes to your character\u2019s dice rolls known as edges and obstacles. These modifiers shift the probability distribution of the dice rolls away from a symmetrical triangular distribution (that has a value of 7 in the middle) to an asymmetrical skewed curve as shown on page 174.For example, a character with the Elasticity Attribute (page 90) receives a minor edge on unarmed attack rolls to express their flexibility advantage. Conversely, a Weapon with the Inaccurate Limiter assigned twice (page 142) gives the character a major obstacle on attack rolls to reflect the imprecise nature of the attack. MINOR\tEDGES\tAND\tOBSTACLES When a minor edge or obstacle is applied to a roll, you roll three dice instead of just the normal two dice. You add together the two highest numbers for a minor edge (discarding the lowest roll), or two lowest numbers for a minor obstacle (discarding the highest roll). For example, if you roll three dice that come up as a 1, 3, and 6, the final roll result for a minor edge would be 9 (3+6) and for a minor obstacle would be 4 (1+3). MAJOR\tEDGES\tAND\tOBSTACLES When a major edge or obstacle is applied to a roll, you roll four dice instead of just the normal two dice. You add together the two highest numbers for a major edge (discarding the lowest two rolls), or two lowest numbers for a major obstacle (discarding the two highest rolls). For example, if you roll four dice that come up as a 2, 2, 3, and 5, the final roll result for a major edge would be 8 (3+5) and for a major obstacle would be 4 (2+2). MODIFYING \tTHE\tDIFFICULTY The GM can also apply edges and obstacles to character rolls when situationally and dramatically appropriate to increase or decrease the difficulty of an action. For example, a character attempting an emergency appendectomy (a Challenging task with TN 18) might receive a minor edge to their Skill roll under ideal conditions, such as being walked through the procedure by an expert surgeon. Conversely, a character riding a horse through an obstacle course (an Easy task with TN 9) might suffer a major obstacle to their Skill roll under exceptionally adverse conditions, such as having to avoid enemy gunfire while negotiating the obstacle course. HHEDGING ROLLSEDGING ROLLS At the GM\u2019s discretion, a player may eliminate the random element of a dice roll for their character by assuming an automatic result of 7 instead of rolling the dice (known as \u201chedging\u201d). Any Attribute bonuses or penalties still apply as normal, adding to or subtracting from the 7 result. A character can use hedging on any roll if the GM permits, including Stat, Skill, Initiative, attack, and defence rolls. The hedging value of 7 is increased to 8 for a minor edge and 9 for a major edge, or decreased to 6 for a minor obstacle and 5 for a major obstacle. 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 182182Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 184--- ACTION ACTION COMBAT IN COMBAT IN BESMBESM Conflict is an essential component of nearly all role-playing games. Physical conflict, or combat, is an important element of BESM \u2013 but important need not be the same as frequent. Combat should be a vital element of a scene and not just a distraction that the GM uses to pass the time. The combat rules created for BESM were designed to mimic the dynamic and fast-paced battles of anime and manga adventures. Whenever a character enters physical conflict with another character or NPC, combat begins. At the beginning of any new combat scene, the characters all make Initiative rolls (page 182). This determines the order they can act in during the combat: the Initiative order. This remains constant for the duration of the combat and under normal circumstances does not change round to round. After the Initiative order has been determined, combat proceeds through a series of one or more rounds. Each round of combat covers from 3-4 seconds of time from the characters\u2019 perspectives, depending on the characters\u2019 actions and the circumstances (the exact time scale is not particularly relevant, with anything from 1-10 seconds appropriate for a round). GMs can have rounds represent more time if it would be dramatically appropriate \u2013 for example, a huge long- ranged space battle. A round is simply the period of time in which an ordinary character can perform one significant action. Characters are normally permitted to take one action per round, though characters with the Extra Actions Attribute (page 92) can act multiple times in a single round. An action is a major activity, such as attacking an opponent (an attack action) or doing something else significant like performing magical ritual, using a special ability, or running away with no thought to doing anything else (a general action). An action can typically also incorporate limited movement while carrying out the activity. Defending against someone else\u2019s attack is not an action, but rather is an automatic reaction in response to an action (see the section on Defence, page 192) Each round of combat is subdivided into two parts: Initiative and character action. The GM resolves Initiative first, then all the participants in a combat get to perform a character action. After they have done so, the round ends and if combat is still ongoing, a new combat round begins. 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 183183 Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 185--- ACTION ACTION 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 184184EXAMPLE  EXAMPLE OF COMBATOF COMBAT The following brief description of how combat can work in BESM continues the example of play from pages 17-19 in Chapter 1. T wo members of the Psychic Assault Corps \u2013 Julian (playing Kozoh, a weapons master) and Lynne (playing Sparks, an augmented tech genius) \u2013 had just run into a small hoard of Bazaroth demons on a spaceship in Earth\u2019s orbit. Rae, the Game Master, was setting the scene. Julian: Kozoh rushes to attack, assuming that Sparks will back me up. Lynne: You know I will! Rae: Because Kozoh is attacking, I want Julian and Lynne to roll Initiative. Dr. Chaz and Hogarth, you may get a chance to influence things later, but hold tight for now. Julian: (rolls dice) Kozoh has Combat Technique (Lightning Reflexes) so that\u2019s a minor edge. With three dice, my highest two results are 5 and 6 so that\u2019s 11. His ACV is 6, for a total of 17. Lynne: (rolls dice) Sparks rolls 5, plus her ACV of 7, for a total of 12. Rae: You are both fast! (She secretly rolls Initiative for the demons and their leader, Azok. Final results are 15 for Azok, and 10 for the demons) Kozoh is first with 17, so you\u2019re up. Julian: I don\u2019t care about the stupid regular demons \u2013 my top priority is taking down the archfiend. I\u2019m going to dodge between the hoard, then launch a flying katana slice at the fiend. Rae: OK, roll your attack. Julian: Kozoh\u2019s ACV is 6, and he has Melee Attack (Sword) Attribute at Level 2 for +4. I rolled an 8 so that\u2019s a final total of 18. Rae: You came around the corner, ran into the demons, and then launched your assault immediately before any of them truly even realised you were there. You fly over the railing, zip past several demons, and the archfiend Azok is too surprised to defend. Your sword slices across its chest. How much damage?Julian: My katana is a Level 3 Weapon and my Damage Multiplier is 7, so that\u2019s a base of 21 points. Add my melee-modified ACV of 10 and that\u2019s 31 total damage. Rae: (Looks at Azok\u2019s character sheet; it has Armour Level 4, which stops 20 damage, so Kozoh\u2019s sword only inflicted 11 damage.) Azok composes itself, smiles, and wipes away a thin line of blood from its naturally armoured chest. Julian: Uh-oh. (to Rae) Do I know if the PAC radiotelepathy gear is still working? Rae: It was last time you checked a few minutes ago. It should be fine, unless something has changed since then. Now as you\u2019re pondering that, at 15 Initiative, Azok pulls back a mighty fist and lashes out with a powerful blow. Do you defend? Julian: Damn straight. I duck and weave. (rolls dice) My final defence total is 14. Is that enough? Rae: (rolling, Rae gets 9 on two dice and adds Azok\u2019s ACV of 10 for a final attack roll of 19) Unfortunately, no. Azok isn\u2019t like its lesser brethren and I made a solid attack roll. Azok\u2019s leathery fist smashes into your jaw. (Calculates unarmed attack damage, including Azok\u2019s Superstrength Attribute) You take 32 damage to the chin! Julian: Ow. Quite a punch! Hey, can I quickly talk to Dr. Chaz via radiotelepathy while I was trying to defend? Rae: If the conversation is short, and if Azok lets you keep any teeth, sure. Lynne: Brutal. Azok is owning you! Julian: Funny, Lynne, funny. (as Kozoh) Chaz, are you there? We\u2019ve encountered hostiles. James: (as Doctor) Oh geez. What? Julian: (as Kozoh) Dammit Doctor, we\u2019re fighting an archfiend and a small hoard of demons. Do something! Why aren\u2019t you here? James: Splitting up was Sparks\u2019s plan! Okay, we\u2019ll get there as soon as we can. Leave some for us! (to Rae) Hogarth and Chaz will abandon the engineering room and race towards the bridge to join in the fight. Rae: (to James) Got it. You\u2019ll be there soon, but not this round obviously. (to Lynne) Sparks, you\u2019re up next at 12 Initiative so what are you doing? Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 186--- ACTION ACTION 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 185185Lynne: I\u2019ve Power Fluxed my left hand into a nasty Level 3 Weapon machine pistol that has one assignment of the Spreading Enhancement, so I\u2019m going to strafe two of the demons. Rae: Cool. As you know, that\u2019s a major obstacle on the attack roll. What do you get? Lynne: My ACV is 7 with +2 from Level 1 Ranged Attack with the handguns focus \u2013 see what I did there? (rolls dice, showing 2, 4, 5, 6) The bottom two dice add to 6, so that\u2019s 15. Rae: (rolls defence once to speed things up for two demon targets since the pistol has Spreading, getting a 14 total) Sparks, your aim is true! You see a look of shock on the demons faces \u2013 first as your hand shapechanges into a gun and then again as they get sprayed in the face with hot lead. How much damage do you inflict? Lynne: Well, a Level 3 Weapon times my Damage Multiplier of 6 is 18, plus 9 for my range- modified ACV, so that\u2019s 27 to each beast. Rae: Ouch, that\u2019s substantial since, unlike their boss, they don\u2019t have armour to soften the blow. They\u2019ll remember that, though. In fact, the two of them rush you on Initiative 10. The other three are climbing over each other to claw at Kozoh. Julian: Hey, I already have my hands full fighting their boss! Rae: Yup, and they want to help Azok tear you apart. First, let\u2019s resolve the two on Sparks since they seem to be quite angry for some reason. (rolls dice twice, since each demon attack is calculated separately; final attack rolls results are 9 and 12). Fortunately, Sparks, their attacks are slow because they\u2019re in pain. Did you want to avoid both demons? Lynne: Of course! I\u2019m clearly stronger, faster, and cuter than those beasts and will taunt them as I step and weave away from their flails. (rolls two defence rolls; a 7 and 9 result). With my DCV of 7, I have a 14 and 16 defence rolls. Is that enough? Rae: Yeah, you\u2019re too fast for them. (to Julian) And now, let\u2019s resolve the three uglies racing towards you. James: (interrupting) Wait, are the Doctor and Hogarth there yet to join the battle?Rae: Umm, no. It\u2019s the same combat round as when Kozoh radioed out so it\u2019s only been a few seconds. You have just started running towards the battle. I\u2019ll let you know. James: But I want to hit something! Rae: (to Julian) As I was saying, you have three demons on you, Kozoh. They don\u2019t seem very smart because they\u2019re just wildly attacking head-on with their claws instead of trying to flank you with their greater number. (rolls three times; final attack rolls are 7, 10, and 15). Defending, I presume? Julian: Oh, yeah. With four of the bads on me, I don\u2019t have a lot of options. I\u2019m trusting our backup will be here shortly, so my enhanced weapons and tactics training will keep me calm and focussed. (rolls dice) My final defence roll is 14 again so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019ll keep my sore chin away from their claws? Rae: It\u2019s difficult to keep your katana between you and Azok and the three demons. Your blade defence is admirable, but one demon feints high and then claws with its foot talons against your thigh. (Calculates unarmed attack damage) Only 9 damage. Julian: Hey team, I\u2019m down one half of my Health Points and it\u2019s only the first round. We gotta do something! Rae: Four-on-one battles do indeed tend to go that way sometimes. Julian and Lynne, roll for Initiative again for the second combat round. (checks with players) OK, with that natural 12 roll, you\u2019re first up Sparks. Lynne: My two demons are wounded but I see that Kozoh is outnumbered and in jeopardy. I\u2019ll Power Flux my right hand into a powerful strobe light like I did when we took down that giant spider in the crypt last month. That\u2019s the Control Environment: Light Attribute so I can try to blind everyone in the room. Kozoh can fight blind, so that\u2019ll give him the advantage. Rae: Smart thinking. Your hand quickly morphs into a powerful strobe and you pulse an intense flash of light. Everyone, including, Kozoh, is temporarily blinded. You closed your eyes, Sparks, so you\u2019re fine. (to Julian) Kozoh has gained the next Initiative. Julian: Excellent. Blindness is just another form of sight for me. Let the slicing continue!Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 187--- Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 188--- Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857) ---PAGE 189--- ACTION ACTION DETERMINING DETERMINING INITIATIVEINITIATIVE Initiative regulates the order in which characters act. It is checked only once, at the beginning of the combat scene, and remains constant for the entire fight. Each participant in the battle makes an Initiative roll using the sum of two dice plus their base Attack Combat Value ( after modification by specific Attributes and Defects ). In addition, the Lightning Reflexes Combat Technique (page 83) gives the character a minor or major edge on their roll. The GM does the same for any NPCs engaged in the conflict. The GM should make a note of the Initiative total rolls of each character and NPC and rank them from highest to lowest (ties remain as ties). This is the Initiative order. The character with the highest total roll has \u201cgained Initiative\u201d and acts first (using all actions, if they has the Extra Actions Attribute), followed by others in descending order. Alternatively, characters can decide to hold their Initiative until some time later in the round. Should two or more characters or NPCs have the same Initiative, the character with the highest Attack Combat Value acts before the others. In the event of another tie, the tied characters act simultaneously. Should additional characters enter the scene mid-way through the combat, roll Initiative for them and assign them a place in the Initiative order based on their rolls. CHARACTER CHARACTER ACTIONACTION Characters act in the sequence determined by the Initiative order. When it is time for a character to act, they may take their single action. If the character has the Extra Actions Attribute (page 92), they may take additional subsequent actions at this time.  TTYPES OF ACTIONSYPES OF ACTIONS There are two categories of action: attack actions and general actions. A character who can perform multiple actions may perform the same or different types of action. For example, a character with one Extra Action could choose to take two attack actions, a general action and an attack action, or two general actions. Furthermore, decisions concerning the specifics of the subsequent actions can be made after the results of the previous action is known. 09: ACTION PAGEPAGE 188188 Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)"
