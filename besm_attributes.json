    "description": "A character with Alternate Form can instantaneously \ntransform into one other specific form that is determined \nduring character creation and approved by the Game \nMaster. Once selected, the choice of form cannot \nusually be altered. Alternate Form allows the character \nto possess a radically different body shape and size than \ntheir normal human form, and exhibit exotic physical \nfeatures as well. See the Metamorphosis Attribute (page \n106) for a variation on Alternate Form.\nIf a character only has a single, permanent, non-\nhuman form, this Attribute should not be applied. \nInstead, the character should acquire the relevant \nAttributes and Defects that best represent the form\u2019s \ncapabilities. A character with several different Alternate Forms should assign this Attribute multiple times. The \nAttributes gained in the character\u2019s Alternate Form \nobviously cannot be Dependent (page 149) upon the \nAlternate Form Attribute. Different Alternate Forms \ncan be built with different Attribute Levels as well. To \ncreate a character with unlimited additional forms, see \nthe Dynamic Powers (page 89) or Power Flux (page \n113) Attributes with a Shapeshifting speciality.\nThe extra form is built from 5 Character Points \nfor each Alternate Form Level, which can be used \nto acquire Attributes and Defects for the form. The \ncharacter retains all the Stat Values, Attribute Levels, \nEnhancements, Limiters, and Defects associated with \ntheir regular body while in the new form; the newly \nacquired Attributes and Defects add to the character\u2019s \nnormal form. If the character\u2019s Stats are modified by the \nAugmented Attribute (page 80) or Shortcoming Defect \n(page 164), the Derived Values (page 168) should be \nrecalculated as necessary. Unless the GM indicates \notherwise, normal clothing becomes part of the \nAlternate Form as well. An Alternate Form may only \nbe assigned if some disadvantage (social or otherwise) \nexists that make staying in form all the time a significant \ndisadvantage.\nREDUCING ATTRIBUTES\nAlthough the Attributes of an Alternate Form \nusually add on top of the character\u2019s base Attributes, \nsometimes the character will need to \u201csell off\u201d a few \nAttribute Levels to best match the player\u2019s concept. In \nthis case, elimination of Levels returns Points to the \ncharacter, which can be allocated to other Attributes.\nFor example, a character with Level 4 Alternate \nForm can add +20 Points to create the new form. If the \ncharacter wants to reduce their Superstrength Attribute \nfrom their normal Level 2 to a new Level 0 (because \nthe Alternate Form does not possess Superstrength) the \ncharacter gains back the 8 Points spent on Superstrength. \nConsequently, the Level 4 Alternate Form now gives \nthe character +28 Points (20 + 8 = 28) to spend on \nnew Attributes. The converse is true for \u201cbuying off\u201d \na character\u2019s normal Defects when using the Alternate \nForm, as the Points available for the character\u2019s Alternate \nForm are lowered appropriately by the Point reduction \nassociated with the Defect.\nIf a character needs to reduce more than two \nAttributes in their Alternate Form, or the secondary \nform is intended to be weaker than the character\u2019s \nprimary form (such as a powerful vampire changing into \na bat), it is probably better to assign the Metamorphosis \nAttribute (page 106) instead of Alternate Form. \nFurthermore, if two or more players wish to create a \ncombined and merged form for their characters, it is \nbetter to assign the Merge Attribute (page 103).Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES\n  SSAMPLE ALTERNATE FORMSAMPLE ALTERNATE FORMS\nThe examples below suggest some Attributes that \nmay be appropriate for specific Alternate Forms, but the \nGM can modify them if desired; it\u2019s a non-exhaustive \nlist. For forms that simply represent different states of \nmatter (such as liquid, gaseous, or incorporeal), the \nChange State Attribute (page 82) may be a better option.\nANIMAL FORMS\nMany nature-based shapeshifters have one or more \nanimal-hybrid forms. Suggested Attributes: any that are \nrelevant to the specific animal form, such as Armour, \nAttack Mastery, Features, Flight, Heightened Senses, \nJumping, Special Movement, Tough, T unnelling.\nELEMENTAL/CHEMICAL FORMS\nThis option covers a wide range of possible forms, \nincluding: acid, base, gold, granite, ice, mercury, water, \nsulphur, synthetic drugs, etc. Suggested Attributes: \nArmour, Augmented, Change State, Elasticity, Extra \nArms, Ground Speed, Massive Damage, Regeneration, \nResilient, Special Movement, Superstrength, Swarm, \nTough, Water Speed, Weapon.\nFLAME FORM\nThe character is composed of fire and can ignite \nflammable objects on contact. Any person near the \ncharacter may suffer burn damage as well. Suggested \nAttributes (which may be optimised for heat and fire): \nArmour, Control Environment, Conversion, Flight, \nForce Field, Weapon (with Aura).\nMELDING FORM\nThe character can meld into any inanimate object \nand perceive nearby events as though they are still \nhuman. Once merged, the character cannot be harmed \nunless the object is damaged. Suggested Attributes: \nChange State, Resilient, Teleport (within the melded \nobject), T unnelling.\nMASS DECREASE\nThe character can decrease their density. Suggested \nAttributes: Change State, Special Movement. Suggested \nDefects: Fragile.\nMASS INCREASE\nThe character can increase their density. Suggested \nAttributes: Armour, Massive Damage, Tough.\nSUPERHUMAN OR MAGICAL FORM\nSome characters like magical girls and heroes \nmaintain dual human/super identities and do not \nhave access to all of their Attributes until transformed. \nSuggested Attributes: any that are relevant to character\u2019s \nother form, often including Armour, Augmented, Extra \nActions, and Weapon.TWO-DIMENSIONAL FORM\nA 2D character has height and width, but not \ndepth. They can squeeze through the spaces between \natoms and are completely invisible when viewed from \nthe side. An entire new two-dimensional universe may \nbe waiting to be explored by such a character. Suggested \nAttributes: Pocket Dimension, Resilient, Special \nMovement, Superspeed.",

A character normally requires a full combat \nround (several seconds) to change between states. When \nthis Attribute is activated, the character\u2019s body lacks full \nsolidarity of a regular form and they don\u2019t have the same \nphysical requirements (such as breathing, sleeping, \neating, etc.) as a normal solid form. Examples of anime \ncharacters that may change into such forms include \nspirits, elementals, monsters, undead, and wizards. This \nAttribute can be assigned multiple times to represent a \ncharacter with more than one non-solid state.\nLIQUID STATE\nA character in liquid state is amorphous and may \nresemble a mobile puddle of water. The character is \nmaterial (but not solid) and can flow through cracks \nin walls, under doors, through pipes, etc. They cannot \npick up solid objects and can only exert the pushing \nforce of a gentle wave. Most physical attacks inflict one-\nhalf normal damage to the character (round down), but \nattacks that cover a wide area may inflict full damage. \nThe character moves at normal speed over ground and \ncan also move through other liquids at a similar speed \n(if the character has the Water Speed Attribute, then \nthose higher speeds are possible).\nGASEOUS STATE\nThis state is less substantial than a liquid state. The \ncharacter cannot pick up solid objects and can only \nexert the pushing force of a gentle wind. Most physical \nattacks inflict only one-fifth normal damage (rounded \ndown) but attacks that cover a wide area may inflict full \ndamage. The character can move through air at their \nnormal ground speed (if the character has the Flight \nAttribute, then those higher speeds are possible).\nINCORPOREAL STATE\nAn Incorporeal state is without physical substance \n(for example, a ghost or living shadow). The character \ncan pass through walls, walk on air or water, and \nperform similar ghost-like feats, though the character \nis still visible as normal. All physical attacks harmlessly \npass through the character while incorporeal, while \nnon-physical attacks (such as mental attacks) retain \ntheir full effects.\nENERGY STATE\nAn Energy state is similar to an incorporeal state, \nexcept the character does not have a normal visible form and only extraordinary non-physical attacks can \naffect them (at the GM\u2019s discretion). The energy can \nbe represented by a force such as electricity, radiation, \nlight, or sound, or can represent a more abstract state of \nenergy such as emotion, data, dream, or one of many \nother possibilities.\n  EENHANCEMENTNHANCEMENT\nQUICK CHANGE \nRather than requiring several seconds, the character \ncan change states nearly instantaneously and may \nattempt to do so as part of a defence roll against an \nincoming attack. This Enhancement grants the \ncharacter minor edge (page 182) on the defence roll and \nsuccess indicates the character changed states instead of \nevading the attack (which may avoid or reduce damage, \ndepending on the state and nature of the attack).",

As long as the \ncharacter has something to hide the equipment (even \nif it\u2019s only long hair or a light robe) the character\u2019s \nweapons will not be noticed by anything short of an \nactual physical search.\nDEFLECTION\nWith a successful defence roll (page 192), the \ncharacter can stand their ground and deflect a ranged \nattack away harmlessly instead of dodging or blocking \nthe incoming attack. This Technique is often used \nto impress or intimidate the opponent, or when the \ncharacter does not want to give ground. The GM may \ndecide that some types of attacks cannot be deflected.\nEXTENDED RANGE\nCharacters with this Technique can double the \ndistances when using ranged weapons (see Range \nEnhancement, page 147).JUDGE OPPONENT\nThe character can judge their opponent\u2019s \napproximate Combat Value and weapon ability from \nthe foe\u2019s attitude and posture even without actually \nseeing them fight. Additionally, the character can \naccurately estimate the opponent\u2019s remaining Health \nPoints. For both of these advantages, the GM should \nprovide descriptive indications such as \u201cyour enemy \nis much better than you are with a sword, but if you \nconnect a few times with your fireball blast, it will drop \nhim,\u201d rather than saying \u201cthe enemy\u2019s Attack Combat \nValue is 7, with a Melee Attack (Sword) Attribute Level \n2, and he has 60 Health Points remaining.\u201d\nLETHAL BLOW\nNormally, unarmed attacks inflict Stun damage \n(see the Weapon Enhancement Stun, page 141). A \ncharacter with this Technique inflicts normal damage \nwith unarmed attacks instead.\nLIGHTNING REFLEXES\nThe character reacts quickly in combat and \nfrequently outmanoeuvres opponents. One assignment \nof this technique gives the character a minor edge on \nInitiative rolls while two assignments gives the character \na major edge (see page 182).\nPORTABLE ARMOURY\nThe character will always have easy access to any \nweapon required for a particular task, including illegal \nweapons and accessories not available to the general \npublic. The actual weapons and accessories must still \nbe acquired via the Gear (page 95) or Item (page 101) \nAttributes, but remarkably, the character can access \nthem whenever needed, instead of being forced to return \nto where they are normally stored. Characters with \nPortable Armoury may also make field modifications on \ntheir weapons, switching Features such as laser sights or \nscopes in a single round.\nREFLECTION\nIf the character has the Deflection Combat Technique \n(see above) and makes both a successful Deflection \ndefence and a successful attack roll (which uses up their \nnext attack action), they can reflect a ranged attack \ntowards any target within range (including the attacker) \nwithout damaging the blocking object. This Reflection \nis treated as a normal attack against the target. The \nGM may decide that some types of attacks cannot \nbe reflected or can only be reflected under certain \ncircumstances (such as requiring a mirrored surface to \nreflect a laser attack).\n05: ATTRIBUTES\nPAGEPAGE\n8383Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES05: ATTRIBUTES\nPAGEPAGE\n8484TOURNAMENT ENCYCLOPAEDIA\nThe character has the ability to recall the vital statistics \nand important quirks of practically all opponents that \nhave participated in one type of tournament (player\u2019s \nchoice; possibilities include martial arts, magical, \ngiant robot, pet monster duels, jousting, grand melee, \netc.).

The character must follow \nthe goals of the organisation in order to gain the use \nof its resources. The other members are assumed to \nbe loyal to the organisation itself, not the Connected \ncharacter. Followers with personal loyalty to the \ncharacter are better represented by Companion (page \n84) and Minions (page 109) Attributes, while resources \nthat belong directly to the character are represented \nby Item (page 101) and Wealth (page 132) Attributes. \nThese Attributes can blend with one another, of course. \nFor example, the Prime Minister of Japan could have \nboth a high Connected Attribute (representing their \nstatus and access to resources) as well as a number of \nCompanions (those individuals personally devoted to \nthe character, for whatever reason).Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES\nFor campaigns in which all players belong to the \nsame organisation that is central to the game (such as a \nsecret society or crew of a galactic freighter company), \nthe GM may decide that the Connected Attribute is not \nrequired. Consequently, this Attribute is optional; the \nGM may prefer to treat organisation membership as a \nbackground detail instead.\nSince Connected measures absolute power that a \nparticular position grants, many smaller organisations \nwill only have a few Levels. A club or small business, for \nexample, will usually have no more than three Levels.\n  EENHANCEMENTSNHANCEMENTS\nSIGNIFICANT POWER \nThe organisation to which the character is connected \nhas significantly more influence within the game setting \nrather than just one with moderate power.

The organisation to which the \ncharacter is connected has an important and diverse role \nwithin the game setting and provides the character with \nmuch larger advantages than one with only moderate \npower. For example, a criminal organisation like the \nYakuza could be considered to have great power in a \nmodern-day urban Japan setting but merely moderate \npower in a game about mystical demonologists.Level 1 Associated.

Examples of minor categories over which the \ncharacter has control include: a classical element (water, \nfire, wind, earth), a limited concept or idea (lust, \nprotection, charm, pride), a minor aspect of nature \n(temperature, friction, insects, sunlight, clouds, orbits, \nsea creatures), or a limited sphere of influence (keys, \nsilence, cats, writing, guns, a small locality, nutrition).\nAlternatively, rather than influencing a simple sphere \nof influence, the character might have minor control \nover a more descriptive realm such as \u201cnever being late\u201d, \n\u201calways having the right amount of money\u201d, \u201cpeople \nlaugh with me, never at me\u201d, \u201calways having the right \noutfit for the right situation\u201d, etc. While these event \nspheres are limited in scope, they also cross all Attribute \nboundaries when appropriate.\nIf the character makes a successful Stat roll (as \ndetermined by the GM; see Chapter 9: Action), they \ncan manipulate aspects of the chosen area of influence. \nSince this is a story-driven Attribute, there are few \ndefinitive rules regarding what a character can and \ncannot do with a particular Attribute Level, with the \nLevel progression being primarily descriptive in nature. \nThis is a very open-ended Attribute and should \nbe discussed with the GM at length to determine the \neffects and limitations in their game.

Force Fields can represent \nmagical barriers, telekinetic shields, divine protections, \nor technological screens.\nA Force Field can be \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown.\u201d When down, \nit does not stop any damage. Unless the Detectable \nLimiter (page 150) is assigned, an up Force Field is \ninvisible. Force Field status must be determined at the \nstart of the character\u2019s actions for the round and cannot \nbe changed until their turn to act in the next round.\nDamage is first reduced by the Force Field\u2019s Armour \nRating, with any additional damage that got past it \napplied against Armour (if any). Thus, if a weapon \nhit successfully penetrates a Force Field, the Armour \nAttribute can still protect against it.\nA typical Force Field is different from Armour, \nsince it can be battered down by a sufficiently powerful \nattack. If an attack inflicts more damage than the Force \nField prevents (even if the rest of the damage is stopped \nby Armour), the Force Field temporarily loses one \nLevel of effectiveness. The character can only regain \nLevels if the field is \u201cdown\u201d and regenerating, unless the \nRegenerating Enhancement is assigned. A Force Field \nrecovers one Level for every full round it is down (turned \noff and not in operation).

If the character\u2019s Force Field is in direct contact \nwith an enemy Force Field, and has a higher Armour \nRating than the opponent\u2019s, the enemy\u2019s field offers no \nprotection against the character\u2019s attack, but it is still \nconsidered up. In this case, the character may actually \nmove through the neutralised field.\nOFFENSIVE\nThe field delivers a powerful electric or energy shock \nto anyone who touches it, as if it possessed a Weapon \nLevel (page 132) equal to the Force Field\u2019s current \nLevel. Thus, the damage inflicted may decrease as the \nForce Field is hit and loses levels of effectiveness.\nREGENERATING\nIf the character uses one general action to regenerate \nthe Force Field while it is up or down, it regains one \nlost Level of effectiveness. A character with the Extra \nActions Attribute (page 92) can regenerate multiple \nLevels each round.\n  LLIMITERSIMITERS\nBOTH DIRECTIONS\nThe Force Field blocks attacks moving in any \ndirection, both inwards and outwards, thereby virtually \npreventing the user from attacking when the Force Field \nis up. This means that when the Force Field is active \nand the user makes an attack, the Force Field will affect \ntheir attack as it would an outside attacker\u2019s (reducing \nthe damage inflicted and going down in Level if its \nprotection value is exceeded).\nINTERNAL\nThe field is only usable inside a specific building or \nother structure. This can be used to represent a Force \nField that protects a vital part of a building\u2019s interior \nsuch as the power plant or dungeon cells, or a character \nwho draws personal Force Field energy from some sort \nof power source inside their headquarters.Level 1 Armour Rating = 10",

    "description": "The character can create mental hallucinations \nthat fools the target\u2019s sight, or possibly more senses if \nEnhancements are assigned. An Illusion appears to be \nreal to the targetted observers but is not really there; \nit has no physical substance, and characters who are \nnot the target of the Illusion are unaffected. Characters \nthat can create Illusions are often sorcerers, demons, \nor people with psionic abilities. See the Projection \nAttribute (page 114) for the ability to create seemingly \nreal images that anyone can detect, rather than mental \nillusions that target the minds of specific people.\nAn Illusion takes a general action to create. It may \nbe of a particular object or entity or of a complete scene \n(such as a furnished room or crowd). It may also be \ncreated over an existing person, scene, or object to \nmake it appear different than it really is. An Illusion \nthat is untended is normally static, either remaining in \none place or (if created over something) moving as the \nunderlying object or entity moves.\nAn Illusion lasts for as long as the character \nconcentrates on maintaining it or for one minute (or \ndramatic scene) if created and then left untended. To \ngive an Illusion the semblance of independent activity \n(such as an illusionary person or crowd that moves \nand speaks) the character must actively concentrate on \nmanipulating the Illusion and perform no other actions.\nThe Level dictates the size of the Illusionary image \nbut it can be created anywhere within a 100-metre range \nof the character. Thus, a Level 3 (10 metres) Illusion \nmeans that any image up to 10 metres in radius (such as \na school bus) can be created and moved around within \na range of 100 metres (such as a city block) from the \ncharacter.\n05: ATTRIBUTES\nPAGEPAGE\n9797Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES05: ATTRIBUTES\nPAGEPAGE\n9898In order for the character to create a convincing \nIllusion of something complex, the GM may require a \nMind Stat check. The GM can assign a Target Number \ndepending on how familiar or unfamiliar the character \nis with the scene that is being simulated. The GM may \nalso give the character a minor or major edge (page \n182) to the roll if they have in excess of the minimum \nLevel needed to create an Illusion. If the roll fails, the \ncharacter\u2019s Illusion is somehow flawed but the character \ncreating it may not be aware.\nWhether or not an observer recognises an Illusion \nfor what it actually is depends on the circumstances \nand should be adjudicated by the GM. For example, \nif a character creates an Illusion of a tiger, it may easily \nfool someone if it is a few hundred metres away; if it \ncomes close to the target, though, the fact that it is \nnot making any sounds will be obvious. The tiger\u2019s \nlack of scent will probably only be a clue to someone \nwho has the Heightened Senses (Smell) Attribute. If \nappropriate, the GM can require Body or Mind rolls \nto \u201csee through\u201d an Illusion  \u2013 typically average (Target \nNumber 12) for the base sight-sense Illusion, increasing \nto difficult (Target Number 15) for illusions covering \ntwo senses or challenging (Target Number 18) for three \nor more senses. If successfully discovered, the Illusion \ndisappears. To create Illusions capable of injuring \ntargets, the character should possess a Weapon Attribute \n(page 132) tied to the Illusion Attribute through the \nDependent Limiter (page 149).\n  EENHANCEMENTSNHANCEMENTS\nEXTRA SENSE\nEach time Extra Sense is taken, the Illusions gain one \nadditional sensory component \u2013 sound, smell, touch, or \ntaste \u2013 that must be specified when the Enhancement \nis assigned during character creation. Continuing the \nearlier example, adding illusionary touch and sound as \nwell as smell doesn\u2019t change the 5 Point cost of the Level \n5 Attribute (that normally has a maximum illusion size \nof 1 km), but the Illusion now functions at three Levels \nlower (Level 2, which allows illusions with size up to 1 \nmetre). The character sacrifices size for complexity and \nbelievability.\nMULTIPLE ILLUSIONS\nA character can normally maintain only a single \nIllusion at a time. The ability to maintain multiple \nIllusions at once is an Enhancement assigned during \ncharacter creation that reduces the effective Illusion \nAttribute Level by 1 for every distinct Illusion the \ncharacter can sustain simultaneously after the first. \nFor example, Level 6 Illusion (10 km size) with an \nEnhancement that allows up to four simultaneous \nIllusions still costs 6 Points but functions three Levels lower at Level 3 (10 m size). A group of related objects \nor entities within the 100-metre range of the character, \nsuch as a furnished room, a swarm of insects, or a horde \nof charging warriors, counts as a single Illusion rather \nthan several. If a character is already sustaining their \nmaximum number of Illusions and wishes to create \nanother one, an existing Illusion must first be dispelled.",

T wo or more Items must have \nthe Merge Attribute at the same Level to represent how \nthese individual Items can temporarily join together \nto create a new powerful Item. Players and the GM \nshould design the new Merged Item with a number of \nCharacter Points equal to 10 Points/Level multiplied \nby the number of Items merging. For example, if five \ncat-themed vehicle Items each with Level 3 Merge can \ncombine into a giant Lion Battle Mecha, the combined \ngiant mecha is created as a distinct Item from 150 \nCharacter Points of Attributes and Defects (since Level \n3 x 10 Points/Level x 5 vehicles = 150).\nThere are no rules that must be explicitly followed \nwhen creating Merged Items, though common sense \nshould apply. For example, if several vehicles combine \ntogether the Merged vehicle should have sufficient \nLevels of the Capacity Attribute (page 81) to carry all the \nindividual vehicle drivers. Similarly, the Armour Rating \nof the Merged Item should probably be at least equal to (or likely more than) that of the pre-merged Items with \nthe greatest Armour Rating. It would also be strange \n(but not unheard of in anime!) for a Merged Item to \nbe smaller than the largest of the pre-merged Items, \nand consequently you should look at the Awkward Size \nDefect (page 156) to determine an appropriate size for \nthe Merged Item. Additionally, the Health Points of \na merged Item \u2013 which is typically equal to the Item\u2019s \nArmour Rating; see page 223 \u2013 is not usually impacted \nby any damage received prior to merging.\nUnder normal circumstances, the maximum \nduration that Items can remain in their Merged state is \nequal to one minute or dramatic scene (as appropriate).\nMERGING CHARACTERS\nWith GM permission, the Merge Attribute can also \nbe assigned to two more characters. Similar to Items, \nthe individual characters must each have the Merge \nAttribute at the same Level. The players and GM then \ntogether design a unique Race Template (page 36) \nfor the Merged form that is built from a number of \nCharacter Points equal to 10 Points/Level multiplied \nby the number of characters merging. For example, if \ntwo magical girl characters each with Level 2 Merge can \ncombine into a powerful magical woman, the players \ncreate a new merged Magical Woman Template from \n40 Character Points (since Level 2 x 10 Points/Level x \n2 characters = 40).\nThe Attributes and Defects of the individual \ncharacter are added together in the combined form \nand then the Merged Race Template is added on top. \nThe Body, Mind, and Soul Stats of the Merged form \nare each equal to the highest Stats of the individual \npre-combined characters and then the Derived Values \n(page 168) are calculated appropriately. Similarly, if \ntwo or more of the individual characters possess the \nsame Attribute before combining, the Attribute Level \nof the Merged form is equal to the Level of the highest \nranked individual character; any Level bonuses from the \nMerged Race Template are then added on top.",

If a target successfully breaks \nMind Control from the same character three or more \ntimes, they are immune to further attempts for the rest \nof the day.\nWhen a player character is under the effects of Mind \nControl, the GM can take over the character from the \nplayer when necessary, although it is more fun if the \nplayer (with GM guidance) continues to role-play the \ncharacter.

In these instances, the GM \nmay give the target a chance to break free of the Mind \nControl even if the target does not regard a command \nas dangerous or distasteful (which would present an \nopportunity to end the control).

Mercenaries who the character hires for specific \ntasks are not Minions since they have an agenda and \nexpect compensation.\nDuring character creation, the player assigns \nthe Minions a number of Character Points up to a \nmaximum of one-fifth the Point total of their character. \nFor example, a character built from 60 Points could \nhave Minions built from a maximum of 12 Points each \n(60 \u00f7 5 = 12). All Minions created by this Attribute \nassignment normally have identical Stats, Attributes, \nand Defects (with very minor and insignificant \nvariations at the GM\u2019s discretion). Minions with \ndifferent Character Point distribution can be created \nby assigning this Attribute more than once to create \na new team of Minions. For example, a character in \na high school setting might have Minions at Level 3 \nto represent a group of athletic students that work as \nschool enforcers for the character and Minions at Level \n5 to represent a different group of street-level spies that \nkeep tabs on city events and act as the character\u2019s eyes \nand ears.",

The Attribute \nwill normally transport the user and everyone else \nwithin the surrounding radius to another dimension. \nSometimes this is the character\u2019s Pocket Dimension \n(page 112). A Portal can usually be held open as long as \na character desires.\nThe Attribute Level determines the number of one-\nway dimensional transitions the user has mastered. For example, \u201cEarth to Bazaroth\u201d is a single dimension link \n\u2013 the user can travel from Earth to the hell-dimension \nof Bazaroth, but not back. If the character wished to \nreturn, a second transition, \u201cBazaroth to Earth\u201d or some \nother form of travel (such a natural gateway) is needed. \nAssigning both \u201cEarth to Bazaroth\u201d and \u201cBazaroth to \nEarth\u201d is two transitions and requires two Levels of \nPortal\u2026 but sometimes this power is one-way journey \nonly.\nA character with only a few Levels of this Attribute \ncan also select links in a way that ensures they need to \ntravel through a chain of dimensions to get home. For \nexample, someone with Level 3 might have: Earth to \nBazaroth, Bazaroth to Ikaris, Ikaris to Earth. This means \nthe character would have to pass through the Bazaroth \nhell-dimension each time they wished to reach Ikaris \nfrom Earth, which could be a perilous journey indeed.\nA dimension can also be defined as the past or \nfuture, provided the GM is willing to deal with any \nissues of time travel that occur. One way to limit portals \nto other times while still permitting characters to visit \nanime staples such as ancient Japan and future Neo-\nTokyo is to say they are really alternate realities (so \nhistory cannot change) and that time flows in a rate that \nremains constant with the present (so characters cannot \nrepeatedly visit the same point over and over). This \nmeans a character living on Earth in 2020 might know \nhow to open a portal to \u201cJapan of four centuries ago\u201d \nrather than \u201cJapan in 1620\u201d \u2013 this minor but significant \ndetail ensures the flow of events is constant, so when \nit turns 2021 on modern day Earth, the character can \nnow only visit \u201cJapan in 1621.\u201d Ambitious GMs can \nhave other dimensions where time flows at different \nrates or where altering events can change the past or \nfuture, but this can easily create various game balance \nproblems.\nPortal is not another version of the Teleport \nAttribute (page 127). A character will usually travel to \na point in the other dimension that most closely maps \nwith the point in their own reality (GM\u2019s option). The \nGM may also rule that visitors are likely to appear at \ncertain nexus points (such as Tokyo Tower on Earth) \nregardless of where they come from, or that their arrival \nis completely random.\nUSING PORTAL ON OTHERS\nPortal may be used offensively to send others to \nanother dimension with or without going oneself. To do \nthis, simply add the Duration Enhancement (see page \n146). This sort of Portal is often possessed by Items such \nas an ancient shrine or machine that contains a gate to \nanother world, sucking anyone nearby into it. The \ntarget will be in the dimension for a maximum amount \nof time indicated by the Duration Enhancement. The Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES\ncharacter is released from the dimension once the \nAttribute\u2019s Duration ceases, reappearing at the point \nfrom which they vanished, or optionally, a different \npoint congruent with their present location, depending \non how that dimension maps with their origin. \nUsing Portal this way on others requires an attack \naction and a successful attack roll against the target. To \navoid being transported, a victim must succeed with a \nBody or Soul Stat roll (Target Number 12) \u2013 whichever \nis easier \u2013 with a penalty equal to the Level of Portal. \nIf the target has the Immutable Attribute (page 99) \nthey may add that Attribute bonus to the roll to resist. \nIf a particular subject resists three successive attempts \nat transporting them to another dimension, they are \nimmune to further Portal attacks from that person for \nthe rest of the dramatic scene.",

It is often used to represent divine, elemental, \nor improvised magical powers, or a powerful high-tech \nItem. At high Levels, the character holds mastery over a \nparticular realm, and has an intimate understanding of \nall things relating to the Attribute sphere. Examples of \nminor categories over which the character has control \ninclude: a classical element (water, fire, wind, earth), a \nlimited concept or idea (lust, protection, charm, pride), \na minor aspect of nature (temperature, insects, sunlight, \nclouds, orbits, sea creatures), or a limited sphere of \ninfluence (keys, silence, cats, writing, guns, a small \nlocality, nutrition).\nThis is a very open-ended Attribute and should \nbe discussed with the GM at length to determine \nthe effects and limitations in the game. Proper use of \nPower Flux will not unbalance the game, but rather can \nprovide many opportunities for character innovation. \nAs an alternative option to Power Flux, see the Dynamic \nPowers (page 89), Power Variation (page 114), and \nT ransmute (page 128) Attributes.A character with this Attribute has a group of \nreserve Character Points (called Flux Points) that can \nbe allocated to different Attributes as often as once a \nminute (or once each dramatic scene, as determined by \nthe GM) within the thematic category chosen by the \nplayer. This often represents a broad-based magical or \npsionic ability, but it can also reflect a character who \nhas several different powered forms or a character \nwho has little control over their range of Attributes \n(in conjunction with the Unpredictable Limiter, page \n153). Stats and Defects cannot be raised or lowered \nwith Power Flux (though the Augmented Attribute may \nbe altered). Fluxing some Attributes may require GM \npermission. Each Level of this Attribute provides the \ncharacter with 5 Flux Points.\nIf the character makes a successful Stat roll (the \nrelevant Stat is determined by the GM), they can assign \nFlux Points to one or more Attributes that grant powers \nthat fit within the thematic category. A Flux Point is \nequal to one Character Point, which can be assigned \nto the cost of the Attribute directly, or to the cost of \nraising an Attribute\u2019s Enhancement Rank (if used and \npermitted by the GM). Under normal circumstances, \nPower Flux cannot be allocated to Companion, \nDynamic Powers, Item, Power Variation, Skill Group, \nor T ransfer Attributes.\nFor example, a character who is the reincarnation of \nan Egyptian cat goddess might take Power Flux (Cats) \nat Level 2 for 20 Character Points, which grants 10 \nFlux Points. Up to once every minute, the character \ncan allocate the 10 Flux Points to any combination \nof Attributes that fit the cat theme. Perhaps in the \nevening the character plans to prowl around the city \nfor several hours to hunt evil demons, leaping from \nrooftop to rooftop, and assigns the following Attributes: \nHeightened Senses (Hearing, Sight) Level 2 (2 Flux \nPoints); Jumping Level 2 (2 Flux Points); Weapon Level \n2 (\u201cClaws\u201d) (4 Flux Points), and Special Movement",

Regeneration cannot repair a dead \nbody, however (see the Reincarnation Attribute, page \n117, for this ability).\n  LLIMITERIMITER\nCONDITIONAL \nSome characters need exposure to a particular \nsubstance or energy source in order to regenerate their \nHealth or Energy Points. The speed of this Regeneration \ndepends on the strength of exposure. The substance can \nbe common, such as sunlight or positive emotions, but \nshould not be something that is omnipresent under \nmost practical circumstances (such as breathable air). \nThe GM should rate the strength of exposure to \na particular condition or substance using five degrees \nof intensity, each of which provides a different rate \nof regeneration: Extremely Weak (1 Point/Level per \nround), Weak (2 Points/Level per round), Average (3 \nPoints/Level per round), Strong (4 Points/Level per \nround), or Extremely Strong (5 Points/Level per round).\nCharacters should usually be able to find Average \nmagnitude intensity substances easily. For example, if a \ncharacter regenerates from sunlight, a sunny day would \nbe sufficient. To continue that particular example, a \nStrong intensity might be the midday sun at the equator \nor unfiltered sunlight in space, while an Extremely \nstrong intensity might be sunlight very close to a star (or \nduring daytime on a planet near a star, such as Mercury). \nSimilarly, Weak intensities should be common (indoor \nlight through a window) and extremely weak should \nbe very common (such as any exposure at all to solar \nradiation). Characters may also find themselves unable \nto regenerate when the substance is absent (such as at \nnight or when underground).The default assumption is that the substance that \ntriggers the Conditional Regeneration is easy to find \n(sunlight, noise, heat, an emotion, plants, etc.). If the \nsubstance is rare, also take the Environmental Limiter \n(page 150).",

    "description": "Skill Groups represents training or natural talent \nin a particular broad field. There are several different \nSkill Groups and each of them is considered its own \nAttribute. Assigning multiple Skill Group Attributes \nat different Levels, therefore, is an ideal method for \ncreating a versatile character. For combat-related \ncapabilities, see the following Attributes instead: \nAttack Mastery, Defence Mastery, Melee Attack, Melee \nDefence, Ranged Attack, and Ranged Defence.\nIn appropriate circumstances, the Level of a \ncharacter\u2019s suitable Skills Group is added to their related \nStat when making a Skill roll to determine the success \nor failure of a task. See Roll Types (page 179) for more \ninformation on Skill rolls.\nSkill Groups are divided into three categories with \ndiffering Character Point costs (from 1 to 3 Points per \nLevel) to reflect their typical utility in most BESM \ngames. The GM may reallocate some of these Skill Groups to different categories \u2013 thus changing their \nPoint cost \u2013 to more accurately reflect frequency and \nvalue in their specific game setting. For example, in \na high school game of romance and student council \npolitical drama, the Domestic Skill Group might be \nbetter categorised under a Field Skill or Action Skill \ninstead of a Background Skill.\nIncluding Skill Groups in BESM Fourth Edition is \na shift from previous editions that used detailed, \nspecific skill lists instead of groups. There are \nnumerous advantages to these collections of \nrelated skills, though several problems may arise \nas well that require GM and player consideration, \nincluding skill overlap and interpretation.\nOVERLAP AND BROAD APPLICATIONS\nThe open-ended nature of the Skill Groups \ncould encourage justifying that a specific activity \nfalls under the realm of nearly any group. For \nexample, extracting information from a street \nthug could be rationalised under:\nOccupation \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a bounty hunter, and deal with \nsuch things regularly.\u201d\nBusiness \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll make a deal with him, selling him \non the virtues of working with us.\u201d\nSocial \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m good at talking with people and will \nconvince him through rhetoric.\u201d\nStreet \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll speak his gang language and ensure \nhe understands the consequences of silence.\u201d\nDetective \u2013 \u201cAfter all my years on the beat, I\u2019m \nhighly adept at extracting information.\u201d\nThis diverse application of Skill Groups is an \nintentional feature, though it may cause some \nconsternation with some players and GMs who \ndesire a more rigid structure.\nPRIMARY USAGE\nIt\u2019s equally important not to make one or two \nSkill Groups essential for survival and enjoyment \nin a game, which discourages from players \ncreating diverse characters. For example, if the \ncharacters with the Adventuring and Street Skill \nGroups are always having the opportunity to use \ntheir talents in the game, while other characters \nare merely sitting back and observing, there may \nbe too much emphasis placed on those groups.GAMING WITH \nSKILL GROUPSGreg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES\n  BBACKGROUND SKILL ACKGROUND SKILL \nGROUPS (1 POINT/LEVEL)GROUPS (1 POINT/LEVEL)\nACADEMIC\nSkills that are rooted in language, research, \ncommunications, and critical thinking.\nARTISTIC\nSkills that are tied to formal and informal expression, \nand related to imagination, creativity, and aesthetics.\nDOMESTIC\nSkills that are often obtained without formal \neducation and that have applications in daily life.\nOCCUPATION (SELECT ONE)\nSkills that are tied to the activities of one specific \ncareer that are often learned \u201con the job\u201d.\n  FFIELD SKILL GROUPS  IELD SKILL GROUPS  \n(2 POINT/LEVEL)(2 POINT/LEVEL)\nBUSINESS\nSkills that cover a wide variety of administration \napplications, such as management, sales, policy, and savvy.\nSOCIAL\nSkills related to community interactions, \ninterpersonal dynamics, and political manoeuvring.\nSTREET\nSkills that reflect familiarity with underworld \nelements as well as urban culture and survival.\nTECHNICAL\nSkills related to gadgets and their functions, including \naspects of mechanics, electronics, and programming.\n  AACTION SKILL GROUPS  CTION SKILL GROUPS  \n(3 POINT/LEVEL)(3 POINT/LEVEL)\nADVENTURING\nSkills that apply to a broad spectrum of exploration \nin wilderness environments.\nDETECTIVE\nSkills relating to police sciences, investigations, \nurban immersion, and subterfuge.\nMILITARY\nSkills connected to organised troop efforts, \nformalised hierarchies, espionage, and combat support.\nSCIENTIFIC\nSkills appropriate to quantitative fields \u2013 biological, \nphysical, medical, mathematical, and natural sciences.Level 1 Developing \u2013 The character is gaining \nproficiency with the Skill Group through \nregular application",

Vampires and demons most often possess this \ndramatic ability. The type of Swarm creature must be determined \nduring character creation. The character can create one \ncritter from their body for every current Health Point, \nmultiplied by the Level in this Attribute. For example, \na character with 130 current Health Points who has \nSwarm at Level 4 could transform into a horde of 520 \ncreatures (130 x 4 = 520).\nWhen transformed into a Swarm, the character \ncannot use any of their existing Attributes. The actions \nof the Swarm are limited to three options: move, \nobserve, and attack. Additionally, all the critters of the \nSwarm must remain within close proximity of each \nother (within a radius of five metres per Attribute Level). \nA swarm\u2019s Attack Combat Value is equal to the Swarm \nAttribute Level + 4. The attack damage is not calculated \nin the usual way, however. Instead, it inflicts a flat 1 \ndamage for every 10 critters (round down; minimum 1 \ndamage) in the Swarm.\nA Swarm can be attacked normally, and each \ncreature in it dies if it is hit (no defence roll is allowed). \nUnless an opponent is using a Weapon Attribute with \nthe Area or Spreading Enhancements (pages 145 and \n141), only a single member of the Swarm can be killed \nper attack (GM\u2019s discretion). Consequently, a Swarm \nof 200 creatures requires 200 attacks to completely \ndestroy. Attacks with the Spreading Enhancement can \naffect multiple critters at a time, while attacks with the \nArea Enhancement can be devastating to the Swarm.\nA character who dissolved into a Swarm may choose \nto revert into normal form during their Initiative in a \ncombat round. To accomplish this, all available critters \nin the Swarm (those not killed or trapped) must join \ntogether. T ransforming back to normal form replaces \nall the character\u2019s actions for that round. The character \nwill return to normal with Health Points equal to the \nnumber of critters that recombined, divided by the \nSwarm Attribute Level (round down). For example, \nif a character with 130 current Health Points and \nSwarm at Level 4 divided into 520 creatures, and after \na battle recombined with only 100 available critters, the \ncharacter would then have a current total of 25 Health \nPoints (100 \u00f7 Level 4 = 25).",

Since fire does not have mass, the Level \nindicates the size of the flames that can be controlled \nand manipulated: small fires at Level 1 (like a candle \nor match flame), up to a large conflagrations that could \nencompass an apartment building at Level 6.\nMETAL\nThe character\u2019s Telekinesis only works on metal. This \nmay be a mystical limitation, or it may be the character\u2019s \nAttribute is actually magnetic (or pseudo-magnetic if it \nworks on most metals).

This Attribute can also be contained \nwithin the Item Attribute (page 101) in order to create \nhand-held weaponry like swords, magic wands, guns, \nor even armed vehicles and suits. Weapons can be used \non a single target each round with melee range (i.e. the \ntarget must be in very close proximity to the character) \nunless further modified by the Range Enhancement \n(page 147).\nA character can only make one Weapon attack per \naction. A battery or barrage of several weapons that \ncan be discharged simultaneously is normally created \nas a single powerful weapon (often paired with several \nEnhancements such as Area, Autofire, or Spreading; see \npage 135-141). The Weapon Attribute may be assigned \nmore than once to give a character (or Item) a variety of \ndifferent attacks.Greg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES\nWhen designing a Weapon, the player (with GM \ninput) should determine exactly how the Weapon \nworks. Is it an eyebeam? Retractable claws? A fireball? \nA psychic attack? A special rapid-strike martial arts \nfinishing manoeuvre? The nature of the Weapons will \ngive the attack role-playing flavour, will provide insight \ninto how the character uses it, and will help determine \nwhat Enhancements and Limiters are appropriate.\nUnlike most Attributes, the Weapon Attribute is \noften assigned at Ranks exceeding Level 6 to represent \nthe wide range of powerful Items and special attacks \ncommon to anime. Discuss your Weapon Attribute \nlimits with the GM. \nWEAPON \nDAMAGE\nA successful \nattack with \nthe Weapon \nAttribute inflicts an \namount of damage equal to the \nWeapon Level multiplied by the \ncharacter\u2019s Damage Multiplier \n(called the \u201cBase Damage\u201d). Most \ncharacters have a Damage Multiplier of 5. Then add the \nattacker\u2019s Attack Combat Value to the Base Damage, \nas well as the effects of any other Attributes that may \napply, to determine the final attack damage. See page \n193 for additional combat damage details.\nExample: Samurai Kenjiro slashes a monstrous ogre \nusing his katana sword. He has an Attack Combat Value \nof 7 and a Damage Multiplier of 5. The katana is an \nItem (Weapon Level 3). Upon a successful attack, \nthe sword inflicts 22 damage (Weapon Level 3 \nx Damage Multiplier 5 = 15 Base Damage \n+ 7 Attack Combat Value = 22 damage).\nCUSTOMISING WEAPONS\nMore than any other Attribute, \nWeapon benefits greatly from \ngame customisations beyond \nthe basic description and \nparameters. The many \nWeapon Enhancements \nand Limiters provided \nherein \u2013 plus the Area, Range, Duration, and Potent Enhancements described \nin Chapter 6: Customisation (page 144) \u2013 help make \neach Weapon Attribute unique to your character. Many \nof these customisations can be assigned more than \nonce as noted, with each assignment decreasing (for \nEnhancements) or increasing (for Limiters) the effective \nLevel of the Weapon.\n05: ATTRIBUTES\nPAGEPAGE\n133133\nGreg Doachi(e Odr2er 495087857)\nATTRIBUTES\nATTRIBUTES05: ATTRIBUTES\nPAGEPAGE\n134134\nUNARMED: THE FREE WEAPON\nAn unarmed person can strike an opponent using \nfists, feet, head, etc. This is a free Weapon Attribute \nthat all characters automatically have and it does \nnot need to be recorded on character sheets. Such \nattacks are considered a Level 0 Weapon with the \nStun Enhancement and Non-Penetrating Limiter. \nConsequently, the damage inflicted upon a successful \nunarmed attack is simply equal to the character\u2019s \nAttack Combat Value (page 169). An exception to this \nguideline applies to characters with the Superstrength \nAttribute (page 124), since such powerful characters \nalso gain +5 damage to their unarmed attacks for each \nLevel of Superstrength.\nLEVEL 0 AND -1\nWeapon is unique among Attributes in that its effective \nLevel can drop to 0 or -1 through the assignment of one \nor more Enhancements, though the minimum Level \nthat you can assign to your character remains at Level 1 \n(costing 2 Character Points). The damage delivered by \neffectively Level 0 Weapons only considers the character\u2019s Attack Combat Value, since the Weapon\u2019s Base Damage \nis 0. For Weapons with an effective Level of -1, no \nactual damage at all is delivered and consequently such \nWeapons only have utility if they have been assigned one \nor more of the following Enhancements: Drain, Flare, \nIncapacitating, Irritant, Quake, or Tangle. Assigning \nmultiple Enhancements that drop the effective Level of \nthe Weapon Attribute below -1 is forbidden; in these \ninstances, simply assign additional Levels to the Weapon \n(costing 2 Character Points/Level) until its effective Level \nincreases to at least -1.\nLevel -1 The attack doesn\u2019t inflict regular damage",
