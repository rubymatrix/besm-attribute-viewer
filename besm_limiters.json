    "name": "Unpredictable",
    "description": "The character\u2019s Attribute frequently does not \nfunction when desired and requires a successful Stat roll \nto use. If the Attribute does not have a \u201cRelevant Stat\u201d \nentry, use the character\u2019s Soul Stat. At the GM\u2019s and \nplayer\u2019s discretion, Unpredictable can also represent an \nAttribute that does not always function in the manner \ndesired. For example, a character with Plant Control \nmight control the wrong plants, or a Force Field \nmight not always appear in the correct place. For this \nalternative, the Stat roll determines if the Attribute \noperates properly with a failed roll indicating that it \nactivates in an unexpected manner.",
