Examples include \nunarmed attacks, shotgun blasts, hollow-point bullets, \nunbated swords, caltrops, a storm of icicles, etc. The \nArmour Rating of Armour and Force Fields is increased \nby 10 against such Weapons each time Non-Penetrating \nis assigned. For example, two assignments of Non-\nPenetrating increase the target\u2019s chainmail Armour Rating \nby 20. This Limiter can only be assigned to Weapons \nthat are somehow reduced in effectiveness by a target\u2019s \nArmour Rating, and consequently cannot be assigned to \nthose with Enhancements such as Insidious and Quake."

    "description": "Stoppable is only assigned to Weapons that also \nhave the Range Enhancement. These Weapons fire \nprojectiles or energy bolts that are sufficiently massive \nand slow enough to be shot down since the attack does \nnot reach the target quickly. One assignment means \nthe attack takes one round to reach its destination;  \ntwo assignments means \nthe attack takes 5 rounds; three \nassignments means the attack \ntakes one minute; four assignments \nmeans the attack takes one hour. Thus, \na cannon shell, bullet, or lightning bolt \nwould usually not qualify since the \nprojectiles travel incredibly quickly over \na short distance, but a guided missile (fast, \nbut travels a long distance) or fireball (short \ndistance, but may travel slowly) might have \nStoppable.Attacking the Stoppable projectile requires a \nsuccessful attack with a major obstacle (page 182) on \nthe attack roll. Furthermore, the defending Weapon \nattack must deliver at least 10 damage to the Stoppable \nprojectile for each Level of the Stoppable Weapon or \nthe projectile is not intercepted. For example, an attack \nmust inflict at least 60 damage to a Level 6 Weapon \nwith the Stoppable Enhancement in order to block/\nintercept/destroy it."

T wo assignments means that \na target who is expecting the attack can also render \nthemselves immune for at least one round (usually \nenough time to escape) if they had prepared for the \nattack by taking a simple precaution such as holding \none\u2019s breath or using a wet rag to resist a toxic gas."
