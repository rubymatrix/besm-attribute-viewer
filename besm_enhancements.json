    "description": "Area defines the radius of influence of the Attribute, \nwhich is usually centred on the character. If the Area \nEnhancement is not assigned to an Attribute, it usually \nmeans the Attribute can affect only a single individual \nperson or object.\nAREA AND WEAPONS\nIf Area is assigned to the Weapon Attribute, the \nattacking character only makes one attack roll, but \neveryone in the Area of effect makes their own defence \nroll. Consequently, some targets in the Area may be \naffected by the Weapon while others may defend \nsuccessfully. Furthermore, the GM may decide that \na successful defence roll is not enough to escape the \nattack completely if there is no nearby cover to move \nbehind that would completely block the effects of the \nAttribute. In these situations, instead of negating the \nArea Weapon effect completely, a successful defence roll \nreduces damage by half.",

Most \nAttributes indicate in their descriptions how long it \noperates normally; adding the Duration Enhancement \nwill increase this time. Duration does not usually apply \nwhen using the Attribute when affecting themselves \n(with the exception of the Mimic Attribute), since the \ncharacter can simply reactivate the Attribute at will. At \nthe end of an Attribute\u2019s Duration, its effects will cease. \nIn circumstances where an Attribute\u2019s effects should be \npermanent, 10 assignments of Duration can be applied \nwith GM permission (10 assignments = 1,000 years, \nwhich can be considered permanent).DURATION AND WEAPONS\nIf Duration is applied to the Weapon Attribute, \nit is usually assigned in conjunction with the Area \nEnhancement. This means the Weapon attack remains \nactive within the affected area for a prolonged period. \nExamples of this type of attack include chemical clouds, \nsheets of fire, electrical charges, or freezing vapours. \nIf someone enters the Area while the Duration is still \nongoing, they suffer damage or other effects as if they \nhave been struck by the attack and will continue to suffer \nthe effects each round until they leave the vicinity. The \nstarting time for Duration when assigned to Weapons is \ndifferent than for other Attributes as noted.",

    "description": "Potent is usually only assigned to Level 1 Attributes. \nTo design an Attribute\u2019s functionality to match a specific \nvision for your character, it\u2019s sometimes necessary to \nassign more Limiters than Enhancements. Doing so \nincreases the effective Level of an Attribute beyond \nthe assigned Level. For example, a player might want \ntheir character to have a version of Flight that requires \nslight concentration while flying (one assignment of the \nConcentration Limiter) and burns 10 Energy Points \nfor every minute of use (one assignment of the Deplete \nLimiter). An Attribute with two Limiters assigned \nfunctions at two Levels higher than the actual Attribute \nLevel so the player would only need to purchase Flight \nat Level 1 (10 kph speed) to gain the benefits of the \neffective Flight Level 3 (100 kph speed).\nBut what if the player only wants their character to \nfly at a top speed of 10 kph (Level 1 Flight) or 30 kph \n(Level 2 Flight)? With the two Limiters assigned, the \nslowest speed from a Level 1 Attribute assignment is \n100 kph (Level 1 + 2 Limiters = effective Level 3 ability). \nThat\u2019s where the Potent Enhancement comes in, which \nprovides a more robust application of the Attribute \nbut reigns in the effective Level to match the player\u2019s \nintention with their character.
