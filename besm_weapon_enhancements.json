    "description": "Counts as 3 Enhancements (Attribute effectiveness \nreduced by 3 Levels). Most Weapon attacks have a visible \ncomponent that makes it easy for targets to determine \nwho is attacking them. An attack with the Inconspicuous \nEnhancement provides no such indication that it is \nabout to strike and does not reveal the identity of the \nattacker. This may result in the attacker gaining surprise, \nwhich prevents the victim from making a defence roll \n(page 192). If the target knows they are under attack, \nhowever, a defence roll can still be made with a minor \nobstacle (page 182) on the roll. Inconspicuous is most \noften associated with non-physical attacks such as ones \nwith the Drain or Psychic Enhancements"
